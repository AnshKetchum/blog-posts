The Numbers

For anyone who wants to try running the same experiments as I have, here’s some information about my GPU that might help. Just want to throw this out here for the bold and brave who wish to try and reproduce my results, and in particular, the compiled SASS code.

GPU Name: NVIDIA GEFORCE 4060 Laptop GPU

Software CUDA Version: cuda_12.0.r12.0/compiler.32267302_0

SM Version: 5.2 in software, but the hardware actually follows 8.9. I’m living on the mercy of backwards compatibility.

Warp Size: 32

Max threads / block: 1024

Total SMs: 24
